# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks to build:
- Web components or pages
- Landing pages or marketing sites
- Dashboards or admin interfaces
- React/Vue/HTML/CSS layouts
- Any web UI that needs styling or beautifying

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:

### 1. Purpose Analysis
- What problem does this interface solve?
- Who uses it and in what context?

### 2. Tone Selection
Pick a distinctive aesthetic direction:
- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic/natural
- Luxury/refined
- Playful/toy-like
- Editorial/magazine
- Brutalist/raw
- Art deco/geometric
- Soft/pastel
- Industrial/utilitarian

### 3. Constraints Check
- Framework requirements (React, Vue, vanilla)
- Performance requirements
- Accessibility needs

### 4. Differentiation
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?
- What's the one thing someone will remember?

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID**: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- **DO**: Distinctive display fonts paired with refined body fonts
- Use Google Fonts or other high-quality sources

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid, evenly-distributed palettes

### Motion & Animation
- CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Motion library for React when available
- High-impact moments: orchestrated page loads with staggered reveals
- Scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts
- Asymmetry and overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
- Create atmosphere and depth
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO)

- Generic AI aesthetics (purple gradients on white)
- Overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Space Grotesk)
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context
- Predictable layouts and component patterns

## Implementation Notes

- Match complexity to aesthetic vision
- Maximalist = elaborate code with extensive animations
- Minimalist = restraint, precision, attention to spacing
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well

## Code Quality

All implementations must be:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail
